                                    You might have assembly course. <br>
                                    I had trouble learning the language to begin with, and found that a lot of assembly tutorials didn’t really help.
                                    In fact, hardly any of them explained it from a beginner’s point of view, and were extremely vague.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    There was only one tutorial I found that really pointed me in the right direction, and it was a guide @tempestatorres5243/, though his tutorial has a few holes in places which makes it sort of impractical. 
                                    So, this website here is an attempt at help an extreme beginner’s level, to help steer away from all of those vague guides out there.

									<b>Consultation</b><br>
									Meeting with the task's specifics, whether it's a course project, laboratory work, or another type of task.
									It involves checking and gethering methodological materials, teacher or project supervisor  recommendations, 
									meeting with development environment, and the rest of toolset. 
									Send the methodological materials for review to get clear understanding of the overall picture and productive meeting.
									During the first meeting, it's desirable to establish deadlines and payment methods.
                                </p>
                                <p>
									<b>Labs</b> <br>
									Laboratory work includes writing functional code according to the requirements specified in the methodological materials
									and by the student, preparing a report, and providing code explanations.
								</p>
                                <p>
									<b>Course Projects</b><br>
									A course project involves writing functional code in accordance with the requirements in the methodological materials 
									and by the student, preparing a report, and providing explanations of the code. 
									Typically, a course project goes with an explanatory note and a significant amount of code, 
									which usually requires more time than laboratory work.
								</p>
                                <p>
									<b>Pair Programming</b> <br>
									Sometimes students find it comfortable to observe the coding process because it allows them to ask questions 
									or clarify important aspects of programming during the meeting. This is a convenient 
									and effective method to meet with the situation closer and prepare yourself for exam or any other defense.
								</p>
                                <p>
									<b>Tutoring</b> <br>
									Classic lessons in assembly programming. A key aspect of programming is practical exercises. 
									Theory takes up no more than 10% of the lesson. For a big fan of computer science.

                                    I'm an assembly fan. I enjoy the process of understanding how hardware and software interact at the most fundamental level.<br>
                                    One more thing that describes me is that I like classic rock. You might assume I play guitar or any other instrument, but I'm just a listener.<br>
                                    What is your music style?<br>

           Data Definitions: Stores user information (name, birthdate, student ID), password hash, key for encryption, and variables for user input and handles.
           Dialog Initialization: Sets up a dialog box with a static text label, an input field, and buttons for "Check" and "Close".
           Password Verification: Reads user input from the dialog, decrypts it using a custom XOR encryption method, and compares it with the stored password hash.
           Message Handling: Handles dialog messages, including initialization and command messages for button clicks. If the password is correct, the dialog closes; otherwise, it exits the application.` },

            title: `This assembly program displays the current time on a 7-segment LED display and updates it every second.`,
            content: `The time is calculated in hundredths of a second since midnight, with noon adjusted to 0. 
           The program initializes hardware addresses, calculates hours, minutes, and seconds, 
           and updates the display, including fractional seconds on LEDs. 
           A macro DELAY is used to add short delays to reduce CPU workload. 
           The main loop continuously updates the time and refreshes the display. 
           Subroutines handle digit-to-segment conversions and hexadecimal to BCD conversions for displaying purposes.` },

            title: `This MASM assembly project demonstrates the creation of a Windows application that calculates and displays mathematical expressions based on user inputs. `,
            content: `Key features include:
           User Interface: Utilizes a modal dialog box for user interaction, featuring a button to trigger calculations.
           Mathematical Calculations: Implements the ElBablo macro to perform complex arithmetic operations on elements of three arrays (MasyvA, MasyvB, MasyvC). The formula used is (a⋅b/4−l)/(41−b⋅a+c).
           Error Handling: Checks for division by zero and provides error messages to the user.
           Conditional Operations: Differentiates outputs based on the results being divisible by 2 or not, updating the final result accordingly.
           Result Display: Uses the MessageBox function to show the results of the calculations in a formatted string.
           This project showcases advanced assembly language techniques, including pointer manipulation, arithmetic operations, conditional checks, and user interface handling in a Windows environment.` },
